# vwelt
(deprecated since 2010)

Developed this Project during school. The task was to create a "virtual world". You got to start at a "Door" to enter this wirtual world. After that you will be placed in a 4-walled-"Room". The wall yo entered this "room" automatically has to get a "door". The three walls remaining could either get another door, leading to another, then generated, empty room, or some kind of "Widget". These widgets were developed by classmates.
